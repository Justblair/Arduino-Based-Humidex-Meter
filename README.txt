Arduino Based Humidex Meter
by Blair Thompson (aka Justblair)

I have for a long time struggled to understand why when my classroom or office air conditioning units read apparent clement temperatures it can still feel unbearably hot.  The reason it turns out is that temperature and humidity combined effect how comfortable an environment is for humans.  This project is a meter that displays and logs the Humidex index for a room.

This project has still some to go, so wiring diagrams etc. are yet to be finalised.  

Eventually the project will be documented at www.justblair.co.uk, until then look at the notes in the Arduino sketch for pin assignations

The project has been compiled successfully on Arduino 023, I have not tested on 1.0 but will get to it one day.

Please feel free to modify the code to your needs.
