Arduino Based Humidex Meter
by Blair Thompson (aka Justblair)

This project has still some to go, so wiring diagrams etc are yet to be finalised.  

Eventually the prtoject wil be documented at www.justblair.co.uk, untill then look at the notes in the arduino sketch for pin assignations

The project has been compiled successfully on Arduino 023, I have not tested on 1.0 but will get to it one day.

Please feel free to modify the code to your needs.
